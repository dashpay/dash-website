In the course of our mission, we have received inquiries into how some aspects of DASH are treated under United States law.  The purpose of this document is to address the most common of these inquiries and explain how we believe the laws apply to DASH.  This is not meant as a legal opinion, and you should consult your own attorneys before relying upon it. However, it is meant to state our position on the law, and how the law should be properly interpreted.

      hero-text: |
        The foundation of Dash is its blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place. This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism called “Proof of Work” (PoW).

        Through a process called “mining,” people use specialized computers to solve extremely difficult math problems. If their solution is correct, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain.

        Once the network verifies that the problem was correctly solved, a new block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded with Dash currency.

        Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). Miners attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a new block to the blockchain. If all the other people running the software agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the blockchain and the miner is rewarded.

        Governance in a decentralized project is difficult,
        because by definition there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project.
        In Dash, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The DGBB system allows masternodes
        to vote for or against proposals, which can then be implemented (or not) by Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016,
        when Dash's Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours,
        consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three years.

      description: >
        The DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments,
        Dash uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a
        masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network.
        If that proposal is approved by at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end of the month a series of "superblocks" will be created.
        At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself
        by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects.

      marsternode-text: Masternodes are required to have 1000 Dash collateral, a dedicated IP address, and be able to run 24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection loss. Masternodes get paid 45% of the block reward on every block, which is distributed to masternodes one at a time. Typically, around 2 dash is paid to each masternode every 7 days.

      what-heading: WHAT IS MASTERNODE?

      earn-heading: Masternode Income
      earn-text: |
        Masternodes cost money and effort to host so they are paid a share of the block reward to incentivize them. With current masternode numbers and rewards masternodes earn approximately a 11% return on 1000 Dash for the year of 2016. This reward falls off in subsequent years but as the value of Dash is rising and the supply of Dash goes down, masternodes should still be sufficiently incentivized.

        This projection also doesn’t count the fees that masternodes earn whenever someone uses its services (InstantSend and PrivateSend).

      what-hero-heading: What is MasterNode?
      instantiend-text: InstantSend (instant transactions). In contrast, Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes to confirm a payment.
      private-send-text: (anonymous transactions). In contrast, Bitcoin transactions are totally public and traceable. Only the identity of the addresses is anonymous.

        A server or a VPS installed with Linux: For the purposes of this guide we will be used Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. We recommend cheap VPSes such as from Vultr and DigitalOcean though any decent provider will do. Generally a low specced one will do. I use the 5 USD ones from Vultr and they work fine.

        A dedicated IP address: These usually come with the VPS/server.

        A little time: When I first got into masternodes, there were only a few guides around and did not cover all the scenarios. It took days for me to figure out the best ways to do everything. However, the process now takes a few minutes. Here are a few guides that I hope will make the process a lot easier.

        If you can’t be bothered with setting up and maintaining your own and don’t mind paying a little extra, you can go with paid masternode hosters which will greatly simplify the process. A few good ones can be found here.

        One of the greatest challenges of building a crypto currency platform is ensuring you create a decentralized system of governance to manage,
        fund, maintain and expand the project. This key element is absent in every currency to date, the natural response is to create a not-for-profit
        foundation that is tasked with maintaining the core protocol and promoting the coin but is not really connected to the coin holders in any meaningful way.
        This approach has a few issues that have been made evident from the experience of older crypto currency platforms.

        to the person doing the work. With this, we could hire core developers and pay them directly after approval of the work in a decentralized fashion.

      evolution-research-heading: РАЗРАБОТКА DASH ЭВОЛЮЦИИ
      evolution-research-text:
        В январе 2016 мы выпустили ранний прототип Эволюции, основанный на Electrum. С тех пор мы написали горы документации, полностью сформировали дизайн целевой Системы и приступили к воплощению его в жизнь.

        Прототип был очень простым - пользовательские действиям в нём ограничиваются денежными переводами с друзьям, а пользовательские данные хранятся на сервере разработчика. Но, по крайней мере, этот прототип доказывает работоспособность концепции.
        Затем мы переходим к разработке и прототипированию всех необходимых технологий, нужных для работы ключевых функций согласно принципам пиринговых сетей. При этом данные пользователей хранятся в защищенном блокчейне Dash и доступны из любого места и с любого устройства. Интегрируется система безопасности, основанная на SPV, исключающая необходимость существования каких-либо централизованных посредников. При этом используется самый распространённый и защищённый от цензуры протокол — HTTP(S).

        Запуск нового релиза ПО 12.1 требует, чтобы все бюджетные предложения были добавлены в систему заново.

        Из-за жёсткого графика генерации суперблоков, имеется лишь маленькое окно для запуска в начале месяца. Для уверенности в том, что мы запустим самую стабильную версию ПО без коллизий с системой бюджетирования Dash, мы решили подождать с запуском релиза 12.1 до начала февраля. Запланированная дата запуска: 5 Февраля 2017.

      architecture-heading: P2P Сеть Следующего Поколения
      architecture-text: >
        Основа технологии Dash - уникальная двухуровневая P2P сетевая архитектура со встроенной системой поощрений. Майнеры поощряются за обеспечение безопасности блокчейна, а сетевые узлы (Мастерноды) вознаграждаются за проверку, хранение и предоставление блокчейна пользователям.


        Мастерноды формируют новый сетевой уровень из серверов, работающих сообща друг с другом в кластерах, называемых кворумами. В результате, это обеспечивает работу новых видов децентрализованных сервисов, таких как мгновенные транзакции, приватность и децентрализованное управление. При этом, эти системы защищены от угроз соответствующих атак на сеть.

        Насколько нам известно, использование Dash не является незаконным в большинстве мировых юрисдикций. Тем ни менее, некоторые юрисдикции могут устанавливать собственные ограничения на использование криптовалют и/или средств защиты приватности – поэтому пользователи, находящиеся в таких юрисдикциях, должны учитывать это перед началом использования Dash. В случае каких-либо сомнений, вам надлежит обратиться к местным адвокатам с целью исключения возможности совершения действий, противоречащих местному законодательству.


        Содержание этого веб-сайта, а также других источников информации, имеющих отношение к Dash, не является средством юридических консультаций. Если у вас появились вопросы по законодательству или вам требуется правовая помощь – пожалуйста, обратитесь к адвокату, компетентному в законодательстве вашей юрисдикции.


        Содержание этого веб-сайта, а также других источников информации, имеющих отношение к Dash, не является инвестиционными советами. Вы должны руководствоваться своими собственными суждениями и исследовать различные источники информации, прежде чем решите инвестировать в Dash.
