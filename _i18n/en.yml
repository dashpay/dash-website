    architecture-heading: Next-Gen Network Architecture
    architecture-text:
      The core of Dash's unique technology is a two-tier P2P network design that rewards users who run a special kind of node called a masternode and host it 24/7 on dedicated hardware. The network requires that those who run masternodes must provide cryptographic proof that they own 1,000 Dash per masternode. This secures the network against Sybil attacks by making such attacks prohibitively expensive.


      Masternodes work together in clusters and can't be faked like fullnodes in other digital currencies. This means they can provide new kinds of decentralized services, like instant transactions, anonymization and governance, without the threat of low-cost network attacks.

    governance-heading: First Self Governing, Self Funding Protocol
    governance-text: Any important project of decision in Dash is agreed and funded by a decentralized public process that funds projects autonomously based on masternode-netwok votes. This means Dash can fund its own growth and adoption, consensus is guaranteed, and everyone is accountable to the network. Not only that, but an attacker can't game the system without buying over half the currency supply.
